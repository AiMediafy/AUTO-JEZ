<p><strong>Google has just improved its Circle to Search feature.</strong> Now, with its help, we can search multiple objects in a single image, opening up new possibilities in visual analysis.</p><h2>What does this mean in practice?</h2><p>Using the Circle to Search tool, we can mark any object in a photo, and Google will find information about it. The latest update now allows for the analysis of several different objects simultaneously, which is particularly relevant in industries such as e-commerce.</p><p>Example? Imagine you, as a user, take a photo of a restaurant interior. With this feature, you can simultaneously search for: <ul><li>the model of chairs you liked,</li><li>the type of plants on the tables,</li><li>the dishes used for serving.</li></ul></p><p>In practice: more data, more context – more possibilities.</p><h2>What are potential business applications?</h2><p>Circle to Search in its new version offers specific benefits for sectors such as:</p><ul><li><strong>e-commerce:</strong> enables better product searches based on customer photos, shortening the purchasing journey.</li><li><strong>marketing:</strong> by analyzing objects in photos, we can better understand user preferences and personalize campaigns.</li><li><strong>AI in image analysis:</strong> more accurate visual data for training models.</li></ul><p>For companies, this means increased efficiency. For example, if Circle to Search cuts the time needed to search for products by half, with a 10-person team, the savings can amount to: <strong>15 h weekly × 10 people × 60 zł/h = approx. 36,000 zł monthly.</strong></p><h2>Challenges and what needs to be considered?</h2><p>As with any AI project: <ul><li>Data quality: photos must be of appropriate resolution.</li><li>Process adaptation: It's essential to train teams to fully utilize the functionality.</li><li>Infrastructure: New image processing models may require additional resources.</li></ul></p><p><strong>From my perspective</strong>, such solutions have tremendous potential but also require consistency between technology and daily processes within companies.</p><h2>What’s next?</h2><p>The improved Circle to Search could be groundbreaking, especially in the area of e-commerce and visual search. It's worth paying attention to this feature if your company uses image analytics in any context.</p><p><em>What do you think? Do you see potential for your industry?
