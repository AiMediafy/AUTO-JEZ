<p>On February 27, 2026, OpenAI announced a strategic partnership with Amazon. The key element of this collaboration is migrating the Frontier OpenAI platform to AWS, and this means one thing: greater accessibility to advanced AI solutions for business clients.</p>

<h2>What does this mean?</h2>
<p>In practice, this entails several significant changes:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Expanded infrastructure:</strong> Frontier, one of OpenAI's most advanced platforms, will now operate in the AWS environment, providing scalability and reliability. For businesses already using AWS, integration may become easier than ever.</li>
  <li><strong>Custom models:</strong> OpenAI will offer the ability to tailor its AI models to specific client needs, which is crucial for industries that require custom solutions.</li>
  <li><strong>Enterprise AI agents:</strong> Through its collaboration with AWS, OpenAI plans to develop AI agents dedicated to large enterprises. This involves technologies that can automate and streamline operations on a scale imagined only by the largest corporations.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Challenges and opportunities</h2>
<p>From my perspective, this is a huge leap forward. However, it's worth remembering that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Effectively using this technology requires solid preparation – high-quality data, strong infrastructure, and clear internal processes.</li>
  <li>Custom model adjustment isn't cheap – be ready for costs, but also for potential profits through automation.</li>
</ul>
<p>If we assume that a typical customer service department spends 20 hours/week on tasks that can be partially automated (e.g., responding to emails or inquiries), with a rate of 60 PLN/hour for a 10-person team, savings can exceed <strong>48,000 PLN per month.</strong></p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This partnership opens up new opportunities, particularly for large companies operating in the AWS ecosystem. <strong>Let’s focus on:</strong> accessibility, implementation costs, and real support for business customers.</p>
